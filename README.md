# Colive App

During my Master’s Degree in Emerging Digital Technologies, for the module “Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice”, I was required to develop a technological startup for which I completed 4 main exercises. I produced a proof of concept using React Native, a whitepaper, a business plan including financials with Excel and Photoshop, and a presentation aimed at potential investors. The startup I created named CoLive had the core goal of providing more accessibility and fair housing opportunities to those more often disadvantaged by the current system. Furthermore, creating strong new communities and providing users with the tools to find similar minded flatmates and landlords was the top priority. By allowing users to connect with each other based on location after finding a flat allowed for international people to faster build communities where they lived.
